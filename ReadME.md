# System Of Linear Equation Solver

### Objective 
* To create program to understand how to solve system of linear equations with n variables and to create a calculator which on taking the input of coefficients of the variables gives us solution set of variables.

### Applications
* This program has diverse applications in field of mathematics as solving linear equation is very basic and key thing, it can be lengthy sometimes to do so. This program can also be used to calculate determinant and inverse of n*n square matrices also.

### System Requirements
* The system should have a gcc compiler installed and its path saved in environment variables.

### Follow the steps to download GCC compiler:
* 1.Visit https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ and dowmload the installer for your architecture(32-bit or 64-bit)
* 2.Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation
* 3.In your environment variables, add a path of the mingw compiler in the path variables.

### How to run the program:
* 1. Click on program.exe present in src folder the program will run in terminal if GCC is installed properply.
* 2. Compile the source code present in main.c on any compiler and run the program.
